# Global project -> Pokemon and their moves (competivive)
*By Beatriz Albiac*

## 1. Project Overview
This project goes over the design and implementation of a data engineering solution aplied to two datasets related to the competitive scene in the Japanese videogame: **Pokemon**. The project is centered aroung the organization and integration of the data in a structured way, so it can be analized and used efficiently later on.

The project develops a data pipeline that integrates multiple datasets thanks to an ETL process, and stores them in a data warehouse focused on the analysis of the data. The solution (?) includes a daily run of the code, monitorization practices (logs and alerts), and the visualization of the data with graphs. On top of that, this document will go over things such as the scalability of the project, the costs of migrating it to the cloud, the use of AI to aid the process and the privacy concerns that may arise.
